# Basicode

This is a (budding) implementation of a BASIC interpreter that's going to become a [Basicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASICODE)
runtime environment that's independent of any emulator (unless you count the Java VM as one).

## Building

You'll need Java 21 and Maven. Just run `mvn package` to build everything and run the tests.

## Licence Information
